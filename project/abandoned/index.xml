A fully featured stopwatch with big buttons.
When you are taking times you can focus on the thing you are timing and don&amp;rsquo;t look at the buttons on the screen.
You can easily switch from left to right handed mode.
Each session is automatically recorded, so you can&amp;rsquo;t accidentally loose data.
For each session you can view the total time, the best lap, the average lap and a detailed list of the laps.</description>
